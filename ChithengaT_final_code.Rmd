This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook for my final project that was aimed at assessing the association between women's empowerment indices and fertility preferences among Haitian  women.  Dataset was A nationally representative sample Haitian women  in the 2016/17 Demographic Health Survey. The first part contains SPSS syntax for  preliminary data management, cleaning, descriptives, and principal component analysis (PCA) with Monte Carlo parallel analysis to derive composite indices.
